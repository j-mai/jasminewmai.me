      <p> Hi, I'm Jasmine, and I am currently a sophomore at Dartmouth College. I am majoring in
          Computer Science modified with Digital Arts, with minors in Japanese and Human-Centered
          Design. I like to code in python and java, and I think app development, virtual reality, and web development are really cool.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am from San Francisco, CA, and I have two pets: a cat and a dog.

      <p>
        When I go back home during breaks, much of my time is spent playing with them.
      </p>
      <p> I look forwared to using the skills that I have learned in my computer science classes and solve
        real-world problems at DALI. In addition, I hope to
        have the chance to work with designers and learn more about design, since it is such
        an integral part in bridging the gap between the user and the code. I am also excited to learn about
        new technology that I have not had the chance to work with so far and collaborate with some talented people!

      <p> In my free time,
        I like watching movies. Some of my favorite films include
          include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception"><i>Inception</i></a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away"><i>Spirited Away</i></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures">
            <i>Hidden Figures</i></a>, and one of my favorite TV series
            is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things"><i>Stranger Things</i></a>
            I also like taking photos and watching NBA games
            (although I haven't been keeping up with the NBA quite as much since I came to college).
            My favorite team is, of course, the Warriors.
      </p>
      <p> I really enjoy traveling and learning about different cultures. Some of the places that I've been
        to include Thailand, Hong Kong, and Japan. Here are some of my pictures from my summer studying abroad
        in Japan!
