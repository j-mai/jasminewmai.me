        <p> I am currently a sophomore at Dartmouth College majoring in Computer Science modified with Digital Arts and minoring in Human-Centered Design and Japanese.
            I am interested in the intersection of tech and design because both are important in creating innovative solutions to the
            challenging problems. I not only like thinking about new technology that can improve our lives, but how we can make it
            easily accessible and usable. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, traveling, and taking photos on my free time. Fun fact:
            If I were to open a business in Hanover it would be a restaurant that serves Taiwanese cuisine and boba.
